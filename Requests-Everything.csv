Barbara Jermyn,barbara.jermyn@greendale.k12.wi.us,"Hi - I have a question for you and maybe you have a tutorial!!! We currently have special education educators who are using flip charts on an interactive white board to promote a multi-sensory differentiated approach to learning.

I have viewed several Pear Deck tutorials but they ALL seem to be having a student interact via their OWN device. Our very involved students cannot utilize a personalize device but rather benefit from the use of a larger interactive board with flip chart activities. Also many of their peers benefit from watching another peer in the interaction on the large board.

Can the decks be used in this format - can they be used with a single user on a touchscreen white board...typing on; dragging; etc.

I can't seem to find any tutorials illustrating this with PearDeck....",3/21/2018,Slides: Student,Accessibility

I understand why you are pushing the Slides integration, it's so much more flexible than the old Pear Deck editor! However, there is one extraordinary drawback that I am compelled to point out.

Using the original editor, text is text and images are images. When I present a Google Slides presentation using the Pear Deck add on, everything is converted into images. This makes for some very pretty decks, but about 2/3 of my audience are ELL students, easily half of whom barely have a grasp of spoken English and can't read English to save their lives...

If I use the Google Slides add on to present my decks, they are locked out.

Another lost option is the ability for students to right-click words in the deck they don't understand and easily look them up or search Google for them without needing to open a new window/tab, switch back and forth and type the unknown word.

Also, is it possible to edit a Google Slideshow with the PearDeck add-on after you've started a session? I realized that I wanted to do student-paced for part of a slideshow and I had answer slides on that one. I didn't know if I could delete those answers slides and it would also update in the session that was already started? Or, could I end the session, edit the slideshow, and then start a new session or would that create all-new responses for students for the entire slideshow?

Jingyu Huo,jingyu.huo@ravenscroft.org,"I'm very happy to see the new features added to Pear Deck this year. As a foreign language teacher, it will be great to have a voice recorder integrated in order to accommodate listening and speaking practice. I would like to be able to insert my voice and have my students respond to my questions orally by just clicking a microphone button. After all, YouTube videos can't solve all the problems.

Natalie Lenzi,lenzin@unionsd.org,"I am going to be emailing our teachers informing them of their new access to Pear Deck. I would like to walk through the sign-up process myself so that I can provide screenshots and help links. However, I don't think my email was provided as part of the setup, because I was given a 30-day trial period after ""logging in."" Specifically, I need admin access. Lauren van Herk needs access too (unless she's already in the system). Her email is vanherkl@unionsd.org.

Next, could you confirm whether teachers need to go through the process below to log in the first time, or is there a way for them to log in the first time using their Google login?",10/16/2018,Purchasing,"P$: Group Management,Google Account Requirement"
Lisa Cheby,lec2937@lausd.net,I am working on a new presentation and in the question prompt slides i am frustrated that I cannot choose a background with more diversity in the student representation. There is one slide that has a boy with brown skin where you drag a marker to show understanding. I would like to see more options like the one where you ask them to share something and see two students where the students are of different races as well as genders.,10/16/2018,Slides: Gslides Add-On,"Slide Library,🙀"
Víctor Arreola,vm.arreola@gmail.com,"Hi my name is Víctor Arreola, I'm from México, I'm an English teacher and I've been working with Pear Deck for a year now, and I'm really happy, this has been the best app I've ever used during my classes. And I want to thank you for that. But hearing about your coming changes in the Editor in December makes me really sad, I know you want to improve your app, but actually it already works because its simple!!! (Keep it like that or at least give us the option to keep using the old version) I really understand there are many improvements with this new editor, but that's the problem, sometimes I design my classes in a few hours from my ipad or my cellphone , that makes it really practical and efficient (and I do believe there many others teachers feeling the same way). That's the reason number 1 that I used Pear Deck the simplicity of teh editor. Your new editor takes a lot of time to (only)start and a simple change or mod in the presentation can take a lot of time too.",10/16/2018,Slides: Editor,LP: Editor Access
Allison,avanliew@ncsaz.org,"I teach physics which involves a lot of diagram, graphs, and word problems. I like being able to add drawing slides for them to show their work, but I'd like to be able to demonstrate how to do it from my side too. Is there a way to draw from the teacher dashboard? We're 1:1 and I'm using an iPad, so right now I either write on a white board at the front of the room or switch to a new app, neither of which is as fun as working within Pear Deck. > Thanks for your time and input!",10/16/2018,"Slides: Presenter,Slides: Student",SL: Annotation
